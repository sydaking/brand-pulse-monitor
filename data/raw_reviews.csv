Submit claim and in 2 to 3 days your reimbursement is in the bank. Love it! If only personal health insurance was that Easy!!!"
2, trust_pilot, 2025-11-23, 1, "Rate tripled year over year Embrace will not cancel when your dog gets old. However, they will raise your rate from $2,500 a year to $9,900 a year for a policy that pays a maximum of $10,000. Embrace met their contracted obligations and advertised statements for 12 years. Approach with caution."
3, trust_pilot, 2025-11-22, 5, "Embrace Answers The rep I spoke to was very understanding and said to submit my claim for my lost pet again and shell see if they will honor it. Anytime I had questions they were there to help me . Its great knowing the company is truly animal friendly !"
4, trust_pilot, 2025-11-21, 5, "Very pleased with Embrace Pet Insurance. I have the normal insurance plus the Wellness addition. I have had a few claims with the Wellness part and have found it very easy to file the claim and received a response within a couple of days. Very pleased with the quick response. I have had the opportunity to speak with customer support and was pleased with the friendly and supportive assistance."
5, trust_pilot, 2025-11-21, 1, "Do not use them Do not use them. After years a decade and a half of using them the abruptly changed my monthly premium for two dogs to 1200$ from 400$ which had been steadily increasing. The maximum pay out is $10000 because I set this up in 2010. Its a disgrace that they treat senior dogs like this. Clearly this is a business and they dont care about your pets. I recommend looking elsewhere or invest the same money into a money market or low risk investment account. I will never use them again."

7, trust_pilot, 2025-11-21, 1, "Ripped me off Ripped me off. I only had my policy a couple days and then they abruptly canceled it and kept my money. I tried to get in touch with them and they are not answering."
8, trust_pilot, 2025-11-20, 5, "Handled our claim with thoughtfulness as well as efficiency. We recently had to say goodbye to our faithful dog Nelson after several visits to the vet. Embrace handled our claim almost immediately. They sent a thoughtful message with condolences and were very help during this difficult time. They also took the time to remove Nelson from our account so I did not have to worry about getting that done and applied a credit for the remaining days of his coverage to our account for our other dogs."
9, trust_pilot, 2025-11-20, 5, "Quick Response Embrace has a very quick response time. My claim was viewed within 24 hours. The app on my phone made it very convenient and easy to complete. The information they give is easily understood."
10, trust_pilot, 2025-11-20, 1, "Avoid this company they will drop your senior dog when you need them most. I was an Embrace customer for over 13 years and used to recommend them to everyone. Sadly I cant say that anymore. This year they raised the premium on my 15-year-old chihuahua from about $2000 to over $10000 annually even with the multi-pet discount. The plan only pays out a maximum of $10000 per year so the new price makes the coverage essentially worthless. Theyre pushing us off the policy without technically cancelling us. My dog has been insured with Embrace since he was 3 and had more than a decade of healthy years with almost no issues. Now that hes developed two conditions that count as pre-existing no other insurer will cover him in any meaningful way. After more than a decade of loyalty were left uninsured when he needs help the most. When I called Embrace for an explanation all I got was a canned response about state-approved rates and rising veterinary costs. Yes vet care has gone up but nothing justifies a fivefold increase in one year. Because of this experience Ill also be removing my younger dog from Embrace. A company that treats long-term customers this way does not deserve our trust."
11, trust_pilot, 2025-11-20, 5, "Embrace is a top notch pet insurance company Embrace provides a very easy claims process with reimbursement sometimes happening on the same day. It also provides great coverage for the money. The support staff is empathetic and very helpful even offering suggestions to lower premium costs without jeopardizing coverage. We have two dogs who have been covered by Embrace for many years and some serious medical issues."
12, trust_pilot, 2025-11-19, 5, "Glad to be here I just signed up for my 2 cats after my last company jacked up the premium for one cat from $160 per month to $550. The person I spoke with was pleasant clear and informative. The sign up process was easy and quick. The rates were very good. So far so good."

14, trust_pilot, 2025-11-18, 5, "Thank goodness for Dog insurance with Embrace My dog was hit by a car and Embrace were very helpful when I called them about this.

I haven paid any of my claims since August so I would say I am not a very happy customer. They used to be great but now not so much.."
18, trust_pilot, 2025-11-18, 5, "I am going to be honest I am going to be honest: I was worried. But my first claim ever submitted was so easy and the wonderful employees at Embrace processed it so quickly delivering me a comprehensive breakdown and everything and a quick return on my refund. My pup needed extensive testing with a specialist and I would do anything for him. Embrace gave me peace of mind that I could do that and more within my policy and have the financial help I needed to do it. I cannot speak more highly of Embrace and will continue to utilize their services for my pup now and my pups in the future."

Last year I had bills that I didn't submit because I dreaded the process. I was overwhelmed with illness in the family and could not not get my head around the forms. however I find this insurance more expensive than others The deductible is outrageous. Dr. Hoffman is fabulous."

23, trust_pilot, 2025-11-16, 1, "Ten Years of Trust Gone Overnight Im really sad to write this review. Ive had Embrace for ten years with no issues and I even recommended them to others long before they had a referral program. As we approached the ten year mark they started calling me nonstop. When I finally spoke with someone they told me my premium was increasing to 4.5x what I had been paying. This was on top of the yearly increases they already apply. They were calling because they KNEW people would be pissed if that auto charge would have happened without letting people know. This is the stage of my dogs life when she needs coverage the most and they raised the premium higher than what I pay for both my own and my sons health insurance combined. It feels like they were trying to push long term customers out before any major vet bills come up. I am extremely disappointed and now my aging dog is left without coverage. Its all shady and typical for an insurance company. I now tell everyone to avoid Embrace and just save money is a pet savings account for the day you may need it."
24, trust_pilot, 2025-11-16, 1, "No Common Sense What went wrong was when I signed up my new puppy, the wellness policy was not added. I turned in a claim and it was denied. Now I have another dog signed up for almost a year. Common sense would tell you to sign up the dog for wellness when I said I wanted the same thing the first dog had. Then I spoke with someone else and they said I could add wellness. I would have to pay over $400.00 because it would have to be backdated to before the dog was born. Senseless!"

Treatment included emergency ICU and stabilization procedures at one practice for two days followed by two additional days at a neurological specialist and advanced care facility. Embrace approved both claims within 24 hours. The claims process was both flawless and seamless - truly outstanding in all regards. In all aspects our experience denoted a competent professional and caring company that provides its advertised services in an exemplary manner. Highly recommend in all regards. 6.0 on a 5.0 scale."

After my dachshund was diagnosed with a significant issue I crossed my fingers that the coverage would kick in and that it would be a seamless and easy process. It has been both simple and easy. I've submitted several claims and all of them were reviewed the day they were submitted and paid that same day. Every call I've had with them has been very helpful and pleasant. They are responsive and seem to really care about my dogs care and my experience. I wish my own personal insurance was as easy!"

62, trust_pilot, 2025-11-12, 5, "Our First Experience With Embrace! Recently our rescue puppy JR now 9 years old required surgery for an ear hematoma. We have had Embrace Insurance since we brought him home but until now had never used it so I was a little apprehensive about filing a claim. I have to say that it was one of the easiest most transparent processes I have ever been through with any insurance company. I uploaded the invoice from the vet answered a few short questions and the submission was done. The time was 3:18 pm EST. At 3:34 pm EST I received an email acknowledging the submission and giving us the good news that the claim was complete and that the surgery was covered by our policy! Embrace kept me informed every step of the way the submission process was simple and clear and the resolution was lightning fast! I am still shaking my head in disbelief at how easy this was and thankful that I kept this coverage from the beginning. This is a great company that I highly recommend! Well done Embrace!!! And THANK YOU!!!"

She was given a clean bill of health and after the required waiting period she has had full coverage up to $10000. At the age of 3 Coco was diagnosed with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency a genetic disease that can be treated but not cured. The treatment is over $500 per month but Embrace has been paying 80% of that cost continuously since she was diagnosed. My rates have not risen any more than a healthy dog and they have never refused a claim."

75, trust_pilot, 2025-11-11, 5, "So Thankful For Embrace Coverage! Pet insurance isnt cheap especially as they get older but it has been invaluable in giving us peace of mind when we've been concerned about a health issue. Our 10-year-old chocolate lab had a lump that turned out to be cancerous then surgery then complications from surgery then three months of follow-up appointments and cone wearing poor thing!. The whole ordeal cost THOUSANDS of dollars and because of the high level plan we had selected 90% of the costs were reimbursed to us. I am so thankful that concerns about money didn't prevent us from essentially being able to save his life. Our tabby cat is 9 1/2 and I just submitted her first claim; our out of pocket expenses will cover 2/3 of the deductible and because I expect additional testing and treatment to diagnose and treat whatever is causing her to have bald spots I am again relieved to know that I can afford to do what is needed for her because soon 90% of the costs will be reimbursed. Like I said, it's pricey but if you can manage the monthly payments it brings so much peace of mind when those big things happen!"
76, trust_pilot, 2025-11-11, 5, "Fast and easy claim process and reimbursement We have been customers of Embrace for over a decade and are always impressed by their service.

83, trust_pilot, 2025-11-11, 1, "Customer Service Grossly Misrepresents their Policies My pet insurance policy was misrepresented to me prior to purchase but Embrace is telling me that they don't uphold anything said by their customer service reps. I attempted to clarify a policy detail with customer service prior to purchasing the policy and they assured me that only pre-existing conditions were not covered by the policy. The reality is that any condition which the insurance company deems related to a pre-existing condition is additionally not covered by the policy. In my case one of my cats has Entropion which is considered a pre-existing condition since she has had it since birth. I paid for the surgery to correct it but now Embrace informed me that any eye conditions (for example conjunctivitis) will not be covered at all by the policy unless the vet can clearly attribute the cause to an injury or other illness. If they cannot they will just assume the eye condition is related to the pre-existing condition (Entropion). This is a gross misrepresentation of the policy given that I explicitly asked customer service questions to try and understand what was and was not covered and this exclusion was not mentioned to me."

UPDATE: Wow did you see how fast I got a response to a negative review but can't get a reply as a paying client re: any questions to my policies or claims??? And yes we can change plans or premiums but if you read the reviews of anyone who has tried it just gets even worse and MORE costly!! AnIMBURSES???? How can it reimburse when it's our own money??? And then you take any remaining funds that are not used at the end of the year. Don't try to spin it any other way than They're just a greedy corporate machine that cares more about profit than the health and well-being of our pets. And this is evidenced by how all they do is defend their shady policies in these comments. Not once have they admitted fault and helped a policy holder instead they just spew their excuses and make no concessions! First they lure you in with low monthly premiums for the 1st year then raise them a ridiculous and unfair amount every.single.year! And do not give the BS excuses for changing info on pet breeds and certain states approving your insane increases because that is just a load of crap. When trying to get reimbursed for treatments or medications they constantly deny deny deny!! And DO NOT let them talk you into their program!!! It benefits no one except them!! You pay into the wellness program with your OWN money use it to pay for all of the many many things they don't cover but at the end of the year if you have unused money in the wellness account THEY KEEP IT!!!! This is a direct quote from their website Any unused amount of the annual maximum will not roll over and is non-refundable.How is this wellness program a benefit to the policy holder? It's not! It's only a benefit to Embrace. I had to take a pet to the ER and the medication the ER doctor thought was the best medication to treat my pet happened to be an over-the-counter medication and not an Rx and Embrace refused to cover it! So now they know better than our vets what's best for our pets? Why should it matter if the RECOMMENDED medication is an FDA approved Rx or not? It's what THE VET recommended! Just wrong wrong wrong. And don't even get me started on how IMPOSSIBLE it is to contact anyone at Embrace!!! I tried for over a week via emailthe claims portal the online chat feature etc and NO ONE would get back to me. But they have TONS OF TIME to comment on all the negative reviews they get here! Unbelievable. I DO NOT RECOMMEND EMBRACE!"

Their rates are very reasonable compared to a lot of other pet insurances. One thing that sometimes irritates me a bit is that the website is slow. Little space dog sometimes takes his sweet time in changing pages. Otherwise no complaints!"
97, trust_pilot, 2025-11-08, 5, "Lots of experience I have had Embrace pet insurance coverage for 2 dogs and 2 cats over the last 7 years. I did not find coverage for the cats worthwhile so I dropped them from my policy. I also did not find the Wellness Program worthwhile as it's basically a savings account specifically for pet use but if you don't use it all like FSA funds you lose it. It was frustrating to see my coverage increase substantially as my dog aged but whenever I needed to use the insurance Embrace came through. The claim submission process is super easy and when my Sparty's time with us came to an end the Embrace staff was incredibly compassionate. Cancer took my best furry friend rather abruptly but the outpouring of sympathy was much appreciated. Thank you Embrace."

After a simple miscommunication between my husband and me we realized that neither of us had submitted the receipt for our pets tick and flea prevention something covered under our wellness plan. We pay $225 split over 12 months for $250 in annual wellness coverage. Unfortunately Embrace requires all wellness claims to be submitted within 60 days of the policy renewal date. Because we discovered the mistake after that deadline Embrace refused reimbursement and kept the $225 we paid. This policy feels intentionally deceptive — a crooked setup designed to profit from policyholders’ honest mistakes. It’s an unreasonable, customer-unfriendly practice that punishes loyalty instead of rewarding it. My advice: stay far away from the Embrace wellness plan. The tiny $25 benefit isnt worth the risk of dealing with such rigid unforgiving policies built to take advantage of policyholders."

144, trust_pilot, 2025-11-01, 3, "Disappointed-confusing and costly I signed up a year ago because I liked the flexibility of customizing my own plan which most other providers don’t offer. Positives: customer service is excellent, very helpful, friendly, knowledgeable; website for filing claims is easy to use once you become familiar with it. Negatives: long learning curve and no training of how to use the website and provide an overview. My biggest complaint is the lack of clarity from the agents while choosing my coverage. It was my understanding that adding a wellness plan would cover all exams and medications, so I waived that coverage from the accident and illness plan. Turns out I was wrong. My advice would be to take great care when discussing coverage with their agents, particularly if this is your first time buying pet insurance. It can be very confusing. In the end, my analysis of the cost of the insurance versus what my OOP would have been without it was that I would have saved a few hundred dollars without it, even with one of my cats becoming sick with pancreatitis requiring lots of tests, meds, and prescription food. So, while my experience was positive on some points, I would recommend taking a chance on your pets’ health and pay the professionals for their service if they get ill, rather than throwing money at a third party that may not cover your costs."

160, trust_pilot, 2025-10-30, 1, "Embrace Pet Insurance is a Scam Embrace Pet Insurance is a Scam - Beware of Their False Denials and Deceptive Practices I am beyond frustrated and furious with Embrace Pet Insurance, which I now consider nothing more than a scam. My pet's breed is highly susceptible to anal gland issues, which causes severe discomfort. When their anal glands become full, my pet starts licking and scooting, clearly in distress. This is not some “preventative” or “wellness” issue - it is a medical necessity. The vet's note was crystal clear: the glands needed to be extracted due to them being full, not because of some routine checkup. However, when I submitted the claim for this required treatment, Embrace had the audacity to deny reimbursement and categorize it under their “wellness” plan, which they claim isn’t covered. This is NOT a wellness issue - this is a treatment for an ongoing medical condition that my pet needs to have addressed for their comfort and health. This is straight-up stealing. They have no problem taking your premiums, but when it comes time to provide the coverage they’re supposed to, they find ways to wrongfully deny claims and push you into paying out of pocket for something that is not your fault. The fact that they classified an emergency medical procedure as preventative care is unethical and deceitful. I would highly recommend avoiding Embrace Pet Insurance if you care about your pet's health and want to be treated fairly. They’ll gladly take your money, but when your pet needs care, they'll find ways to deny it. It's a scam - pure and simple. Stay away and find a more honest company that actually stands behind their coverage. And now they will follow up with an illogical response to this review, consisting of an incorrect reasoning by fraud scammers who want to steal people’s money. Wellness plan is for preventative care ONLY. In my pet’s case, her anal glands were ALREADY full as per the doctor’s notes. Hence, the treatment should have been covered by her existing plan and NOT WELLNESS PLAN. This is what the insurance policy providers have been doing to deny eligible claims and STEAL PEOPLE’S MONEY- just providing illogical and baseless reasoning and not addressing the real issue. Hence strict action should be taken against them, their ridiculous response and unwarranted justifications should be FLAGGED, and people should be made aware of their unlawful practices."

But things have been covered exactly the way I expected them to be with no sneaky loopholes or unexpected exceptions. our reimbursement payment once we met our deductible landed in our bank account within the same week that we filed our claim. We even had one claim that needed to be reviewed because it appeared possible that our pet was being seen for something that had been an excluded condition.

I always found Embrace custormer service top notch and the company trustworthy. They are a little pricey, but I found the customer service and claims process to outweigh the cost."
195, trust_pilot, 2025-10-27, 5, "Excellent service Easy transactions"
196, trust_pilot, 2025-10-27, 2, "Loss of value Embrace has lost its value. We are researching other pet insurers and find a lack of options offered by Embrace. While not the most expensive insurance the coverage for the price is found lacking. Negotiating the Web/App is difficult and lacks transparency. We were unable to find our payment information and future cost easily. We have been with Embrace over 5 years. We have never made a claim. We hope to never need to. However, our good stewardship goes unrecognized and premium continue to rise."
197, trust_pilot, 2025-10-27, 3, "They took another look Typically I have been giving Embrace 5 stars and a few weeks ago I did. Since my dog had surgery for a cancerous mass, I dropped them down to a one, but am now giving them credit where credit is due. Although I had to work much too hard to get them to look at what made logical sense, they did and I am now happy with the reimbursement I am receiving for the claim. I have no doubt they will get back to a 5 in my mind, just not quite there yet. Thank you for listening to logic and making the right call."
198, trust_pilot, 2025-10-27, 4, "Happy until now I've been very satisfied with this company until now. They have been insuring my husband's service dog for 11 years. The cost suddenly shot up, they said it was due to inflation and the dog's age. He's had few problems in this time, and it seems that their rates should continue in his senior years. I can no longer afford this company."
199, trust_pilot, 2025-10-27, 3, "Claim process Submission of a claim was fairly simple. When additional information was needed they reached out to the provider. I had to take Jack to an emergency vet as our normal vet does not have night hours. I received an Email telling me how much of my claim was approved with little explanation. With a vet bill of over $1100 I felt the reimbursement of slightly over $300 was on the low side. Still I’m glad I had insurance to get some money back"
