Now that hes developed two conditions that count as pre-existing no other insurer will cover him in any meaningful way.

The reality is that any condition which the insurance company deems related to a pre-existing condition is additionally not covered by the policy. In my case one of my cats has Entropion which is considered a pre-existing condition since she has had it since birth. I paid for the surgery to correct it but now Embrace informed me that any eye conditions (for example conjunctivitis) will not be covered at all by the policy unless the vet can clearly attribute the cause to an injury or other illness. If they cannot they will just assume the eye condition is related to the pre-existing condition (Entropion). This is a gross misrepresentation of the policy given that I explicitly asked customer service questions to try and understand what was and was not covered and this exclusion was not mentioned to me.""",NEGATIVE,0.9995390176773071,Severe,5,Senior pet premiums skyrocketing

And yes we can change plans or premiums but if you read the reviews of anyone who has tried it just gets even worse and MORE costly!! AnIMBURSES???? How can it reimburse when it's our own money??? And then you take any remaining funds that are not used at the end of the year. Don't try to spin it any other way than They're just a greedy corporate machine that cares more about profit than the health and well-being of our pets. And this is evidenced by how all they do is defend their shady policies in these comments. Not once have they admitted fault and helped a policy holder instead they just spew their excuses and make no concessions! First they lure you in with low monthly premiums for the 1st year then raise them a ridiculous and unfair amount every.single.year! And do not give the BS excuses for changing info on pet breeds and certain states approving your insane increases because that is just a load of crap. When trying to get reimbursed for treatments or medications they constantly deny deny deny!! And DO NOT let them talk you into their program!!! It benefits no one except them!! You pay into the wellness program with your OWN money use it to pay for all of the many many things they don't cover but at the end of the year if you have unused money in the wellness account THEY KEEP IT!!!! This is a direct quote from their website Any unused amount of the annual maximum will not roll over and is non-refundable.How is this wellness program a benefit to the policy holder? It's not! It's only a benefit to Embrace. I had to take a pet to the ER and the medication the ER doctor thought was the best medication to treat my pet happened to be an over-the-counter medication and not an Rx and Embrace refused to cover it! So now they know better than our vets what's best for our pets? Why should it matter if the RECOMMENDED medication is an FDA approved Rx or not? It's what THE VET recommended! Just wrong wrong wrong.
