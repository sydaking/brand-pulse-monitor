The plan only pays out a maximum of $10000 per year so the new price makes the coverage essentially worthless. Theyre pushing us off the policy without technically cancelling us. My dog has been insured with Embrace since he was 3 and had more than a decade of healthy years with almost no issues. Now that hes developed two conditions that count as pre-existing no other insurer will cover him in any meaningful way. After more than a decade of loyalty were left uninsured when he needs help the most. When I called Embrace for an explanation all I got was a canned response about state-approved rates and rising veterinary costs.

UPDATE: Wow did you see how fast I got a response to a negative review but can't get a reply as a paying client re: any questions to my policies or claims??? And yes we can change plans or premiums but if you read the reviews of anyone who has tried it just gets even worse and MORE costly!! AnIMBURSES???? How can it reimburse when it's our own money??? And then you take any remaining funds that are not used at the end of the year. Don't try to spin it any other way than They're just a greedy corporate machine that cares more about profit than the health and well-being of our pets. And this is evidenced by how all they do is defend their shady policies in these comments. Not once have they admitted fault and helped a policy holder instead they just spew their excuses and make no concessions! First they lure you in with low monthly premiums for the 1st year then raise them a ridiculous and unfair amount every.single.year! And do not give the BS excuses for changing info on pet breeds and certain states approving your insane increases because that is just a load of crap. When trying to get reimbursed for treatments or medications they constantly deny deny deny!! And DO NOT let them talk you into their program!!! It benefits no one except them!! You pay into the wellness program with your OWN money use it to pay for all of the many many things they don't cover but at the end of the year if you have unused money in the wellness account THEY KEEP IT!!!! This is a direct quote from their website Any unused amount of the annual maximum will not roll over and is non-refundable.How is this wellness program a benefit to the policy holder? It's not! It's only a benefit to Embrace. I had to take a pet to the ER and the medication the ER doctor thought was the best medication to treat my pet happened to be an over-the-counter medication and not an Rx and Embrace refused to cover it! So now they know better than our vets what's best for our pets? Why should it matter if the RECOMMENDED medication is an FDA approved Rx or not? It's what THE VET recommended! Just wrong wrong wrong.
