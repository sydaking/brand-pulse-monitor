- "Do not use them Do not use them. After years a decade and a half of using them the abruptly changed my monthly premium for two dogs to 1200$ from 400$ which had been steadily increasing. The maximum pay out is $10000 because I set this up in 2010. Its a disgrace that they treat senior dogs like this. Clearly this is a business and they dont care about your pets. I recommend looking elsewhere or invest the same money into a money market or low risk investment account. I will never use them again."
- "Avoid this company they will drop your senior dog when you need them most. I was an Embrace customer for over 13 years and used to recommend them to everyone. Sadly I cant say that anymore. This year they raised the premium on my 15-year-old chihuahua from about $2000 to over $10000 annually even with the multi-pet discount. The plan only pays out a maximum of $10000 per year so the new price makes the coverage essentially worthless. Theyre pushing us off the policy without technically cancelling us. My dog has been insured with Embrace since he was 3 and had more than a decade of healthy years with almost no issues. Now that hes developed two conditions that count as pre-existing no other insurer will cover him in any meaningful way. After more than a decade of loyalty were left uninsured when he needs help the most. When I called Embrace for an explanation all I got was a canned response about state-approved rates and rising veterinary costs. Yes vet care has gone up but nothing justifies a fivefold increase in one year. Because of this experience Ill also be removing my younger dog from Embrace. A company that treats long-term customers this way does not deserve our trust."
- "Glad to be here I just signed up for my 2 cats after my last company jacked up the premium for one cat from $160 per month to $550. The person I spoke with was pleasant clear and informative. The sign up process was easy and quick. The rates were very good. So far so good."
- "The process was much easier than previou The process was much easier than previous experiences. Last year I had bills that I didn't submit because I dreaded the process. I was overwhelmed with illness in the family and could not not get my head around the forms. however I find this insurance more expensive than others The deductible is outrageous. Dr. Hoffman is fabulous."
- "Ten Years of Trust Gone Overnight Im really sad to write this review. Ive had Embrace for ten years with no issues and I even recommended them to others long before they had a referral program. As we approached the ten year mark they started calling me nonstop. When I finally spoke with someone they told me my premium was increasing to 4.5x what I had been paying. This was on top of the yearly increases they already apply. They were calling because they KNEW people would be pissed if that auto charge would have happened without letting people know. This is the stage of my dogs life when she needs coverage the most and they raised the premium higher than what I pay for both my own and my sons health insurance combined. It feels like they were trying to push long term customers out before any major vet bills come up. I am extremely disappointed and now my aging dog is left without coverage. Its all shady and typical for an insurance company. I now tell everyone to avoid Embrace and just save money is a pet savings account for the day you may need it."
- "Quick and easy submission Quick and easy submission. Terms of the policy seem to be fair and really help. Years ago I had pet insurance which did little to nothing."
- "Invited Tries to deny claims Theyre an insurance company that does everything they can to deny a claim. Did you bring your pet to the vet after noticing strange behaviors and symptoms? Well according to them that dont qualify for insurance even if your pet is prescribed medicines and/or a diet."
- "Always very quick with a fair response Always very quick with a fair response. Recommend this pet insurance for anyone with pets."

I have had the opportunity to speak with customer support and was pleased with the friendly and supportive assistance."
- "Handled our claim with thoughtfulness as well as efficiency. We recently had to say goodbye to our faithful dog Nelson after several visits to the vet. Embrace handled our claim almost immediately. They sent a thoughtful message with condolences and were very help during this difficult time. They also took the time to remove Nelson from our account so I did not have to worry about getting that done and applied a credit for the remaining days of his coverage to our account for our other dogs."
- "Embrace is a top notch pet insurance company Embrace provides a very easy claims process with reimbursement sometimes happening on the same day. It also provides great coverage for the money. The support staff is empathetic and very helpful even offering suggestions to lower premium costs without jeopardizing coverage. We have two dogs who have been covered by Embrace for many years and some serious medical issues."

- "I am going to be honest I am going to be honest: I was worried. But my first claim ever submitted was so easy and the wonderful employees at Embrace processed it so quickly delivering me a comprehensive breakdown and everything and a quick return on my refund. My pup needed extensive testing with a specialist and I would do anything for him. Embrace gave me peace of mind that I could do that and more within my policy and have the financial help I needed to do it. I cannot speak more highly of Embrace and will continue to utilize their services for my pup now and my pups in the future."
